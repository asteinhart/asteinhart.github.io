- Markdown content
- Syntax highlighting
- Fast builds
- Easy deployment

## Writing Posts

To create a new blog post, simply create a new `.md` file in the `content/blog/` directory with the following frontmatter:

```toml
+++
title = "Your Post Title"
date = 2026-01-11
+++
```

Then write your content below the closing `+++` markers.

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
