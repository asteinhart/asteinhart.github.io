        new standards for "AI safety and security, protecting Americansâ€™
        privacy, advancing equity and civil rights, and promoting innovation and
        competition, and more."
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to these new standards, the executive order requires that
        "the Director of [the Office of Management and Budget] shall, on an
        annual basis, issue instructions to agencies for the collection,
        reporting, and publication of agency AI use cases."
      </p>
      <p>
        To comply with this order, the federal government released the first
        ever

          >Federal AI Use Case Inventory</a

        in 2023. As technology continues to develop at a rapid pace, this
        inventory marks an important moment in prioritizing how advancements can
        be utilized for the public good in ways that are safe, secure, and
        transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the inventory is not without its flaws. The site only provides
        a CSV file, neglecting to provide any summary statistics or a way to
        view the inventory such as in a table. As the federal government's

        What exactly is a "use case of AI"? The term Artificial Intelligence
        (AI) has been used since at least the 1950s and generally refers to
        technologies that
        <a

          >"make computers do things that are thought to require intelligence
          when done by people."</a

        A preferred term by many in the field is

          href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained"
          >machine learning</a
        >
        , which better captures the underlying mechanism in which computers use
        math and vast amounts of data to find patterns and apply it to new data.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recent years, the meteoric rise of
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model"
          >large language models</a
        >, such as ChatGPT, have dominated the popular understanding of AI.
        Underlying these models is not magic, but rather mathematical concepts
        from the mid-century that have been applied to vast amounts of data,
        recently made possible by advancements in computing power. Companies in
        all industries have

          >jumped on the hype and mystery</a
        >
        around AI to begin labeling as many new technologies and services as AI
        as possible in order to capture a sense of super intelligence that
        models like ChatGPT invoked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Federal AI Use Case Inventory contains some of this over
        generalization. Technologies that have likely been used for decades in
        the federal government that do not use new advancements in machine
        learning or AI are included in this list alongside use cases that do
        genuinely use new technologies and AI. These misclassifications can harm
        our ability to establish
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.gov/ai-use-cases/"
          >"strong guardrails to ensure AI keeps people safe and doesn't violate
          their rights"</a
        >
        as the Biden Administration has set out to achieve.

          As discussed above, what exactly is considered a

          for many people outside of the field. In the inventory, the term AI is

          definitions of AI such as machine learning models that use

          The inventory requires departments to list a technique to categorize

        While reviewing the <a target="_blank" href="link">guidelines</a> for
        the inventory, there appears to be lots of value information that was
        collected that was not shared in this instal release. This includes
        questions such as TODO. It appears this initial release was a collection
        of each of each department
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.gov/ai-use-cases/">posted page</a>.
        One may be able to get some of this information by viewing the inventory
        from each individual department&#39;s link
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.gov/ai-use-cases/">here</a> or this

      <p>
        As a quick aside, its worth mentioning the impact that the format of
        data can have the accessability and usability. One of the principles of
        posted by
        <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.data.gov/"
          >resources.data.gov</a
        >, an online repository of policies, tools, case studies, and other
        resources to support data governance, management, exchange, and use
        throughout the federal government, is that the data is
        <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.data.gov/PoD/principles/"
          >accessible</a
        >
        meaning that open data from the government should be"made available in
        convenient, modifiable, and open formats..." and "...should be made
        available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes,
        often by providing the data in multiple formats for consumption."
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, this is rarely upheld as anyone that works with
        government data knows that you never know what format the data will be
        in. One of the most common formats are PDFs which are often easy to view
        on a computer but much more difficult to access the data to analyze and
        are not
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://resources.data.gov/glossary/machine-readable-file/"
          >machine-readable</a
        >. On the flip side, tabular data formats like CSVs or Excel files are
        machine-readable but impossible or at the least difficult to analyze.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are governments addressing these concerns by providing "multiple
        formats for consumption" including machine readable formats as well as
        dashboards, charts, and maps to allow users with a variety of technical
        skills to still access and use the data. The City of Chicago&#39;s
        <a target="_blank" href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/"
          >Open Data Portal</a
        >
        is one example.
