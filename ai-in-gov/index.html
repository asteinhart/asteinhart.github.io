        In October 2023, the Biden Administration issued an

          >establishes</a
        >
        new standards for AI safety and security, protects Americans’ privacy,
        advances equity and civil rights, stands up for consumers and workers,
        promotes innovation and competition, advances American leadership around
        the world, and more."
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to creating new standards for AI safety and security, the
        executive order requires that the "the Director of [the Office of
        Management and Budget] shall, on an annual basis, issue instructions to
        agencies for the collection, reporting, and publication of agency AI use
        cases."
      </p>
      <p>
        To comply with this order, the federal government created the first ever
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.gov/ai-use-cases/"
          >Federal AI Use Case Inventory</a
        >. As technology continues to develop at a rapid pace, this inventory
        marks an important moment in addressing the ways that that technology
        can be utilized for the public good in ways that are safe, secure, and
        transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the inventory is not without its flaws. For anyone that has
        worked with government data knows, providing data in a accessible format
        is never a given. Attempting to view the inventory simply begins a
        download of a csv file.

          id="use-case-button"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        I will give them one point for providing a
        <a

          >machine-readable</a
        >
        format and then promptly take a point away for just providing a 710 row
        CSV file. This format is essentially useless for most people. They
        neglect to provide any summary statistics or way to view the inventory
        such as in a table. As the federal government's
        <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.data.gov/PoD/principles/"
          >own principles</a
        >
        outline, this data is not accessible and is not "available to the widest
        range of users for the widest range of purposes."

          The Federal AI Use Case Inventory contains 710

          one use case.
        </div>
        <div class="scroller" id="sExample">
          For the inventory, each department and agency submitted their own list
          of use cases. For example, the Department of Treasury included a
          <span class="highlight ex">Collection Voice Bot</span>, an model to
          help direct a taxpayer down a certain call path given their verbal
          response over the phone.

        <div class="scroller" id="sDep">
          The use cases are spread across 21 departments and agencies including

          What exactly is considered an "use case of AI"? The collected
          inventory shows that the federal government struggles to provide a

          The inventory requires departments to list a technique for each use
          case however categories are not standardized across departments making
          them difficult to group. In addition, despite it being labeled as
          mandatory in the

            >provided iventory instructions</a
          >, over 50% of use cases have
          <span class="highlight non">no listed technique</span>. 10 of the 21
          departments did not provide a technique for a single reported use
          cases including the Department of Commerce, the Department of Health
          and Human Services, and the Department of Veteran Affairs.

          Using the use case titles and summaries, I attempted to standardize
          and fill in missing techniques. While this is not a perfect
          categorization, it does give insight into how the federal government
          is using AI. TODO Blank % of the models were this and that. See all

          In addition to technique, just 2% of the use cases have
          <span class="highlight ex">publicly available source code</span>. This
          raises concerns about the transparency of AI tools being used by the
          federal government.

          Also included in the inventory is information indicating a use case's

          stage.

          Of the use cases that did include a development stage, roughly 50% are
          currently in use, 25% are in development, and 25% are in planning. As
          expected, AI use in the federal government will only continue to
          increase in the years ahead.

        While reviewing the <a target="_blank" href="link">guidelines</a> for
        the inventory, there appears to be lots of value information that was
        collected that was not shared in this instal release. This includes
        questions such as TODO. It appears this initial release was a collection
        of each of each department
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.gov/ai-use-cases/">posted page</a>.
        One may be able to get some of this information by viewing the inventory
        from each individual department&#39;s link
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.gov/ai-use-cases/">here</a> or this

      <p>
        As a quick aside, its worth mentioning the impact that the format of
        data can have the accessability and usability. One of the principles of
        posted by
        <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.data.gov/"
          >resources.data.gov</a
        >, an online repository of policies, tools, case studies, and other
        resources to support data governance, management, exchange, and use
        throughout the federal government, is that the data is
        <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.data.gov/PoD/principles/"
          >accessible</a
        >
        meaning that open data from the government should be"made available in
        convenient, modifiable, and open formats..." and "...should be made
        available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes,
        often by providing the data in multiple formats for consumption."
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, this is rarely upheld as anyone that works with
        government data knows that you never know what format the data will be
        in. One of the most common formats are PDFs which are often easy to view
        on a computer but much more difficult to access the data to analyze and
        are not
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://resources.data.gov/glossary/machine-readable-file/"
          >machine-readable</a
        >. On the flip side, tabular data formats like CSVs or Excel files are
        machine-readable but impossible or at the least difficult to analyze.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are governments addressing these concerns by providing "multiple
        formats for consumption" including machine readable formats as well as
        dashboards, charts, and maps to allow users with a variety of technical
        skills to still access and use the data. The City of Chicago&#39;s
        <a target="_blank" href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/"
          >Open Data Portal</a
        >
